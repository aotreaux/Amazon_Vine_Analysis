# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

Overview

The purpose of this project was to evalute the value of subscribing to a Vine program. Overall, the goal of a Vine program is to incentivize consumers with free merchandise (or by another means) to write good reviews on the products they purchase through Vine. By utilizing PySpark, AWS, and PostgreSQL, we can extract, transform, and load data to utilize in our analysis.

Results

For those utilizing the Vine Program, we saw a 46% submittal of 5-Star reviews. This was based on a total of 32 reviews with 15 of those being 5 star. For those not utilzing the Vine Program, we saw a 52% submittal of 5-Star reviews. This was based ona total of 45,387 reviews with 25,733 of those being 5-Star.

Summary

It would appear that perhaps the Vine Program would not be beneficial fo rthis particular retail scenario. The overall usage of the Vine Program vs. the non-Vine Program lends to the opinion that the program is not very popular with consurmers. If consumers feel strongly about a product in a positive way they do not need to be incentivized to leave a positive review.
